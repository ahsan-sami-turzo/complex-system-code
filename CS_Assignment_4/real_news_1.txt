Chelsea are ready to sell club captain Reece James this summer in order to meet the Premier League's PSR threshold, with Conor Gallagher also on the transfer list. 
Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has played down speculation Vinicius Junior could leave the club due to the racist abuse he has continually received while playing in Spain.
While Real Madrid are not currently open to letting Vinicius go, they could soften that stance if Erling Haaland becomes available, with a potential swap deal on the cards with Manchester City. 
One man expected to join Real Madrid is Kylian Mbappe, but PSG head coach Luis Enrique has admitted he still has hope the forward will change his mind and remain at Parc des Princes.
Manchester United will allow Christian Eriksen to leave the club this summer after he admitted he is unhappy with his playing time at Old Trafford.
In terms of incomings, Manchester United would be willing to pay roughly £50m in order to sign Gleison Bremer from Juventus. 
Arsenal and Chelsea have been told they will have to pay £68.5m in order to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP this summer.
Brentford's Ivan Toney has also been linked with Arsenal and Chelsea, but he is now edging closer to a move to West Ham instead.
Liverpool have been offered the chance to sign Sporting CP centre-back Goncalo Inacio for around £52m at the end of the season. 
Robert Lewandowski has turned down the opportunity to treble his wages in Saudi Arabia and will remain at Barcelona. 
Tottenham are planning to make three or four signings during the summer window and want to get their business done early on, but they are unlikely to bring in a 'superstar'.
